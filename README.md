# Graphdb

I built a GraphDB-powered project using Neo4j, leveraging its graph structure for efficient relationship-based querying and data analysis. This setup enables fast, scalable, and intuitive data retrieval, ideal for recommendation systems, knowledge graphs, and AI-driven insights. By integrating graph-based search and visualization, the project enhances connectivity, pattern detection, and deep analytics. ðŸš€
